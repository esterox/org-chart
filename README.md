Our Organizational Chart tool helps you easily visualize and manage your company’s hierarchy! With a user-friendly design and flexible features, you can create your organizational structure just the way you want. Whether you’re adding new teams or reorganizing existing ones, our tool makes it easy to add members in the way you want and then visually differentiate their relationships- whether linked or not, allowing you to tailor the chart to reflect your organization’s true structure.

Here’s how it works:

**Build Your Hierarchy**: Quickly add members to any position with the "+" button in each node, instantly creating new branches. Each node allows you to:

Enter the position title.
Select the person for the role.
Easily add subordinates or remove the node entirely.

**Linked vs. Independent Members**: Keep team members linked under the same manager using the branch’s "+" button to maintain a connected hierarchy. Want flexibility? Create independent branches by clicking the "+" in individual member nodes, allowing members to operate separately under the same manager.

**Unlimited Flexibility:**  Add as many branches and members as needed! Each branch grows independently, perfect for even the most complex organizational structures.

# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
